# MatchMaker Checkpoint Project
# By Zachary Talmadge

# Description
In this project, I built a compatibility-based "MatchMaker" application. This full-stack app will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other,pre-set users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user who is the best overall match.
